# Python Workshop

This is a workshop to learn some of the most powerful Python programming features. We will get to know a workflow that will help you get the job done and keep things organized, unveiling new features and tools that will help you draw the best out of your code.
Most of the content we will be covering is available in the Python standard library. However, we will be using some packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/) and also we will be learning about some things that are still in development and are yet to be applicable for Python.

The workshop is a high level overview on the Python programming language current and near future status. It is aimed at C programming language students and will be lectured in Portuguese.

Some of the topics we will cover are:
